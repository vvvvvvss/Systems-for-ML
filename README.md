# Systems for Machine Learning

On the 13th, 14th and 15th, we had an exceptional experience at the *Systems for Machine Learning* workshop conducted by the ACM student chapter of IISc Bengaluru. With an overhwelming inflow of Machine Learning and Deep learning models we often forget to learn or understand what's under the hood. This workshop explored exactly that. Nine sessions, one panel discussion, one live demo and one hands-on project across three days.

## Session 1 : Edge AI for Advanced Automobile In-Cabin Experience
***Keynote speaker - Dr. Amod Anandkumar, HARMAN Automotive***

## Session 2 : Introduction & Overview: Systems in ML
***Speaker - Divij Ghose***

## Session 3 : Edge Computing - Deploying ML on the Go
***Alka and Anusha, Harman***

## Session 4 : Spiking Neural Networks For Engergy Efficient And Fault Tolerant Neuromorphic Computing
***Dr. Gopalakrishnan Srinivasan, IIT Madras***

## Session 5 : Software & Profiler Basics for ML 
***Sunny Manchanda, DRDO***

## Session 6 : Case Study & Lab: Accelerating ML Workloads 
***Kautuk and Mayank, IISc***

## Session 7 : Foundational Models as OS
***Dr. Suparna Bhattacharya, HPE***

## Session 8 : Distributed ML - Getting Started 
***Dhruv Garg, Georgia Tech***

## Session 9 : Ensuring Reliability â€“ Scalability & Fault Tolerance
***Dibjajyothi & Dhanya Matthew***

## Panel Discussion
**Topic: Do We Need More Models or Better Systems for AI Breakthroughs?**
***Moderator: Dr. Kalapriya Kannan (Intuit)***
***Speakers: Dr. Anjaly Parayil (Microsoft), Dr. Sriparna Saha (IIT Patna), Anchal Gupta(NVIDIA), Dr. Sumit Kumar Mandal (IISc Bangalore), Dr. Praveen Jayachandran (IBM Research)***
